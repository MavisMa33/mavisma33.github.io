# note-book-for-coding
All I learned about coding.

Hi everyone! Iâ€™m Mavis, a fitness coach working in a small gym. I start from zero to learn to code and enjoy my journey at Codecademy so far.

My goal is:
1. Become a Front-End developer.
2. Get hired.
3. Support my family and friends with what I learned.
